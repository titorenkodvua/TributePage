    <h3 id="headline">Here's some facts about Napoleon Bonaparte</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Born in 1821 to Carlo Buonaparte, a lawyer, and his wife, Letizia Ramolino, Napoleone Buonaparte was the fourth and the second surviving child of the couple.
      </li>
      <li>
        Academically brilliant, young Buonaparte completed his preliminary education from a
        France's College d'Autun before applying at the Militaire in Paris. However, his
        two-years term was cut short to one year post his father's demise.
      </li>
      <li>Trained as an artillery officer, he joined as second lieutenant in La Fire
        artillery regiment in 1785. Serving at the Revolution in Corsica, he was promoted
        to the rank of a captain in the regular army in 1792.
      </li>
      <li>The fall of the Jacobins led to the rise of Maximilien de Robespierre, thus
        initiating the dictatorship of the Committee of Public Safety. In 1795, the
        Directory took over the control of the country.
      </li>
      <li>Bonaparte who had supported the Directory all through came under their good books
        and was named Commander of the Army of the Interior. Additionally, he was made
        trusted advisor to the Directory on military matters.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1796, he took over the working of the Army of Italy and transformed the once
        underfed-disgruntled army into a strong military force that helped expand the French
        empire by winning numerous battles
      </li>
      <li>
        Post the great victory over Austria, he moved over to Middle East, occupying Egypt.
        Meanwhile, he also weakened the British Empire by upsetting their trade route with India.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as much his image was enhanced in his initial accomplishments, the battle of Nile
        tarnished it all as Admiral Horatio nelson crushed his army. Also, the same resulted in
        the crushing defeat of France against the coalition formed by Britain, Austria, Russia
        and Turkey.
      </li>
      <li>
        Returning to France, he made plans with Emmanuel Sieyes that would allow them to retain
        their topmost position in the government. He formed a new constitution which created
        position of the first consul.
      </li>
      <li>
        He was involved in the creation of Bank of France and supervised the centralisation of
        the government. Such was the escalating popularity of this French military and political
        leader that he was elected consul for life in 1802 and in 1804 made the Emperor of France.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, the negotiated peace lasted for about three years after which France was at
        war with Britain, Russia and Austria. While it lost to British at Trafalgar, the French
        army registered a victory against both Austria and Russia at Austerlitz.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1810, defeat of his army resulted in the fall of his empire. The country was in bad
        shape as both the country's military budget and military officials were devastated. The
        news spread like wildfire and with increasing international pressure and lack of resources,
        he surrendered to the allied force in 1814.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite being exiled to Elba, he did not lose his will power and soon escaped to Paris,
        where after a short stay, he returned to power. Though he did manage to make a magnificent
        comeback at Belgium where he defeated the Prussians, at Waterloo, he suffered a blow once
        again with a defeat against the British.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1815, he resigned from the powerful position that he held. Though he did make an offer
        that his son, Napolean II to be named the emperor, the coalition declined the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        The British government, for the fear of his return, sent him to a remote island of St.
        Helena in the southern Atlantic. Though he was free to do what he pleased, the routine
        life did not get very well with this military leader.
